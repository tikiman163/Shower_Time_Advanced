Advanced Timer Creation App for sending advanced timers to Pebble Time app Shower Time by Dale Flamm

This is an android application I'm designing with the capability to create custom timers to be
consumed by a companion application I have already written for the Pebble Time smart watch.
The basic functionality of the Pebble Time app includes a basic stop watch, with the ability to
set an interval for how often the watch should vibrate, notifying the user. With this
application, the user will be able to set multiple periods of time with associated intervals.

The purpose of this application is to broaden the capabilities of the Pebble app to be usable
for tasks such as cooking which may require periods of different length where reminder
notifications are helpful on a regular basis such as reminding the user to stir a pot every
minute for fifteen minute, then remind the user to baste a roast with the pots contents every 15
minutes for 4 hours.

Notifications come in the form of the Pebble Time watch vibrating in the basic app, with the
advanced android app, the ability to display a message will be implemented. Once this app is
completed both it and the Pebble Time companion app will be available for free on the google
play store and pebble apps store.
